newmanWattModel.m creates a network using the newman watts model

clique.m creates a 'ring of pearls' network, where there are alpha k-cliques, and each of those cliques are connected to each of the others by one edge

cliqueVec.m is a varient of clique.m, where instead of all cliques being of uniform size, I can input a vector that determines the size of the cliques; there are still alpha cliques, and each clique is attached to each other by one edge
